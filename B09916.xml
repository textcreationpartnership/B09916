            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Rules of the Schools AT THE JESUITS in FANCHURCH-STREET.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THe Invention of Opening these Schools is, to Teach Youth Vertue and Learning: They shall be Taught <hi>Gratis;</hi> nor shall they be at any farther Charges or Expences than the buying of their own Pens Ink, Paper and Books.</p>
            <p n="2">II. These Schools are common to all, of what condition soever, and none shall be excluded, when they shall be thought fit to begin to learn Latin and Write sufficiently well: And in these Schools shall he taught Greek and Latin, as also Poetry and Rhetoric, as they shall rise to higher Schools.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And altho' Youths of different Professions, whether <hi>Catholicks</hi> or <hi>Protestants,</hi> come to these Schools; yet in Teaching all, there shall be no distinction made, but all shall be Taught with equal Diligence and Care, and every one shall be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to his Deserts.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. There shall not be, either by Masters or Scholars, any tampering or medling to persuade any one from the Profession of his own Religion; but there shall be all freedom for every one to practise what Religion he shall please, and none shall be less esteem'd or favored for being of a different Religion from others.</p>
            <p n="5">V. None shall upbraid or reproach any one on the account of Religion; and when any Exercise of Religion shall be practised, as hearing <hi>Mass, Catechising,</hi> or <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or any other; it shall be lawful for any <hi>Protestant,</hi> without any molestation or trouble, to absent himself from such Exercise, if he please.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. All shall be Taught to keep God's Commandments, and therefore none shall be permitted to Lye, Swear, or Curse, or talk uncivil Discourse; Nor shall fight or quarrel with one another; and he who shall be observed to fail in these Duties, shall be punished according to his demerit: And when any one, for these, or other Faults, shall be adjudged to any Chastisement, if he shall refuse to receive such Chastisement quietly, or be stubborn, he shall be Expell'd the Schools, and not be re-admitted again, until he shall have given satisfaction for such his Fault.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. All shall be in their respective Schools by a quarter before Eight in the Morning, and shall there stay until Ten and a half: Again at a quarter before Two, until half an hour after Four. And all Parents are earnestly desired to send their Children timely to School, and not easily to stay them at home; for the neglect of some Days may hinder the Profit of many Weeks and Months: And they are to send them decently Clad.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The other hours of the day they shall Study at their own Homes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare those Exercises, which the Masters in the Schools appoint to be brought, at their next coming to the Schools. And therefore all Parents are desired to allow their respective Scholars such conveniency for their Studies at their own Houses, that they may comply with those Duties which are appointed them.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. All are required to be exact and diligent, in daily frequenting the Schools, and being there, none are to go out without leave of their Master; and when any one shall be absent from School, he shall the next day he comes bring from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents a Ticket of the lawfulness of such his absence: Yet they shall have every Week two Afternoons of Recreation, in which they come not to School; unless a Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day happen that Week, which shall then be their Recreation-day.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Such as come from the Writing-School, and have no Entrance in Latin, are to be received but three times in the Year, <hi>viz.</hi> at the beginning of the <hi>New Year,</hi> at <hi>Easter,</hi> and about our <hi>Lady-day</hi> in <hi>September.</hi>
